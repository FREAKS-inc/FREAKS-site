            <h1>JOT</h1>
            What is Jot?
            <br>
            Jot is a note-taking app that lets you quickly throw down your ideas so you DONT FORGET THEM!
            <br>
            It is designed with inspired individuals in mind, don't you just hate it when you get a <i>brilliant</i> idea, and before you get the chance to realise it, it's gone?
            <p><b>WE</b> hate that</p>
            <br>
            Use Jot, it sorts your notes with <strong>tags</strong>, a feature that makes finding notes easier and putting them down easier.
            <br>
            <strong>Tags</strong> are little (ideally) one-word descriptions that can be used to search through your note collection to find the specific note you were looking for.
            <br>
            Have an idea for a song beat? The tags &lt;music&gt;, &lt;beat&gt;, and &lt;dubstep&gt;, along with some automatic tags.
            <br>
            The next time you want to find that note you can search for any of those tags, and adding more tags will help narrow down the search. You can also use this to find notes you forgot about (THAT'S THE POINT OF THE APP!! TO PREVENT THAT!)
